FlexgetConfig
=============

Configuration for Flexget

Note that all sensitive info (RSS feed URLs, deluge auth, etc.) has been moved into the includes/ directory which will not be committed. Rest assured, though, that these are standard uses of the deluge, from_deluge and rss plugins.

aria2 Plugin
============

I have a plugin WIP for [aria2](http://aria2.sourceforget.net) in the plugins directory. It works for me and documentation should be semi-self-explanatory when looked at in conjunction with my config files, but YMMV. If/when it is submitted for inclusion with Flexget, it will be documented.
